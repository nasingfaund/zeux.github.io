## Work

I’m a technical director at [ROBLOX](http://corp.roblox.com/). Previously I worked as a rendering engineer at [Sperasoft, Inc.](http://sperasoft.com/) on FIFA 13 and FIFA Street titles, as a PS3 programmer at [Saber Interactive](http://www.saber3d.com/) and as a lead engine developer at CREAT Studios; during my career I’ve helped ship many games on PS2/PS3/XBox 360/PC; check out the [screenshots and brief information about my contribution to them](http://zeuxcg.org/projects/).

## Projects

I'm also working on a wide variety of open-source projects, most of which are hosted [on GitHub](https://github.com/zeux/). Here's a short selection:

### pugixml

[pugixml](http://pugixml.org/) is a light-weight C++ XML processing library with an extremely fast and memory efficient DOM parser and XPath 1.0 support. It is used in a wide range of applications, including various embedded systems, video game engines, offline renderers, web backends and robotics/space software. A lot of effort goes into making sure pugixml has an easy-to-use API, has as few defects as possible and runs on all widespread platforms.

### qgrep

[qgrep](http://github.com/zeux/qgrep) is a fast grep that uses an incrementally updated index to perform fast regular-expression based searches in large code bases. It uses [RE2](http://code.google.com/p/re2/) and [LZ4](http://code.google.com/p/lz4/) along with a lot of custom optimizations to make sure queries are as fast as possible. Additionally it features a Vim plugin for great search experience in the best text editor ;)

### codesize

[codesize](http://github.com/zeux/codesize) is a tool that shows the memory impact of your code using a hierarchical display adapted to work well in large C++ codebases. It works by parsing debug information from PDB/ELF/Mach-O files. The purpose of the tool is to let the developer quickly find areas in the codebase that can be improved to gain memory by reducing code size, which is particularly important on memory-constrained platforms.

## Publications

Here are some talks and publications I've done over the years:

* The Performance of Open Source Applications (2013), Chapter 4: Parsing XML at the Speed of Light. [Read online](http://aosabook.org/en/posa/parsing-xml-at-the-speed-of-light.html) or [buy the book](http://aosabook.org/en/buy.html#posa) (all royalties are donated to [Amnesty International](http://www.amnesty.org/))
* Russian Game Developers Conference 2010, "Job scheduler: as simple as possible". [Slides](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11731051/talks/kri2010_en.pdf)
* Russian Game Developers Conference 2009, "SPU Render". [Slides](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11731051/talks/kri2009_en.pdf)
* Russian Game Developers Conference 2008, "Baking graphics resources for next-generation platforms". [Slides in Russian](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11731051/talks/kri2008.pdf)

I also have a [blog](http://zeuxcg.org) with technical posts on various subjects.
